# abnormal-cell-detection
A basic OpenCV based algorithm to differentiate abnormal cells from healthy ones in a microscopic image of a slide containing the same.

Refer to the 'cellGroup_image_processing_concept.pdf' document in the 'resources' directory to learn more about the concept.

The universal cell counting output of the prototype can be seen in the 'totalCellCountOutput.jpg' image and the abnormal cell detection output of the prototype can be seen in the 'abnormalCellCountOutput.jpg' image, both of which are present in the same 'resources' directory.
